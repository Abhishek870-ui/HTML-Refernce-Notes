			The first column shows the character in a box. The box is wide enough to accommodate the widest Unicode Plane 1 character, which happens to be Arabic Ligature Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem (﷽). If a character is not centered in the box, that's because it is a combining character, a superscript, a subscript, or a modifier of some kind such as an accent, or some combination of these such as Combining Double Macron. If the character does not exist in your browser's font, an error glyph is shown; for example, Firefox shows the hexadecimal character code (same as the second column).
		The table has 65506 rows, so it takes some time to load. The information comes from various trusted sources at different times; it's not guaranteed to be perfect, but thousands of entries were updated in September 2021, reflecting characters and names that were added in the last 20 years. The missing names for the Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs (starting at about 3400) are normal; the Unicode Consortium has not given names to them.
